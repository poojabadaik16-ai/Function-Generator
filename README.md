# Function Generator — OpAmp-Based Circuit

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a **function generator** using **operational amplifiers (Op-Amps)** to produce **square** and **triangular** waveforms.

## 🧠 Overview

This project includes:

- Design of a square wave generator using an OpAmp-based Schmitt Trigger.
- Implementation of an integrator circuit to convert square wave into triangular wave.
- Transient analysis using Multisim to verify waveform characteristics.
- Exploration of how resistor and capacitor values affect output frequency.

## 📌 Key Highlights

- **✅ Square Wave Generation**  
  Designed a square wave oscillator using an OpAmp configured as a **comparator with hysteresis**, forming a Schmitt Trigger-based oscillator.

- **✅ Triangular Wave Generation**  
  Used an OpAmp-based **integrator circuit** to convert the square wave output into a triangular waveform.

- **✅ Transient Simulation**  
  Simulated time-domain response to observe signal transitions, frequency behavior, and output integrity.

This project reinforces concepts of **analog signal generation**, **OpAmp applications**, and **waveform shaping** using fundamental circuit principles.
